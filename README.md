### Introduction

This is my solution to the second programming assignment in the R programming course.

Methods here provide the ability solve for the inverse of matrices faster by caching the inverse of the matrix

### makeCacheMatrix
- Creates a modified Matrix whose inverse is easily cached 


### cacheSolve 
- Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
